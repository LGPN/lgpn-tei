# lgpn-tei

This repository contains the data of the LGPN project converted to TEI. It is used to power the LGPN Database Search (now in preparation).

Data is organized into subdirectories for persons, places, bibliography etc. 

Persons collection is further subdivided by volume, which for the most part corresponds to the name of the volume a person has been originally listed in. Nevertheless, new individuals may be in time added to the volume, based on the region they lived in. Currently the LGPN volumes I to V.B are available.
